### About me
I'm a German full-time software engineer, diving deep into backend programming these days. I started tinkering with code when I was 15 and I've been hooked ever since! Currently, I'm all about Ruby. My mantra? Code should be clean and readable.

### What else?
But hey, coding isn't my whole world! In my spare time, you'll often find me immersed in gaming adventures or diving into the captivating worlds of AniManga. Chainsaw Man and Hunter x Hunter are among my top favorites :P
